Progressive long spoken of the demimonde.\\nEven bolder move, central word system ‘or only the central word\\' the\\nbefore, even if it is outlawed and feared more than anything else. Even\\ndeath is ridiculous in comparison. To say the opposite of a great theory Is\\nagain one that is just wrong. Many physicists seem to lack the\\nfoundation. Therefore, we wasted on you still have a majority of the best\\nresources to bloated pseudo-random draw theories. Here is one more\\nother ways already. Instead of even a rolled-up dimension does one\\nexplain the environment by hand, with what one finds. Four dimensions\\nsufficient to describe the half of the world. There is no single event that\\nhappened a whole. No process Is created or destroyed matter, e = + mc\\n2. The empty space, the dead universe, the featureless universe. The\\nlabel is the central word. The central word = What Is the situation in the\\nborder area of intelligence? It is easy to set up a Sub-space model quickly\\nto bend even a dimension theoretically. In practice it has never had a use\\nout of it. They exist, the theorists, but they are smiled sympathetically.\\nNo, by the exceptional talent, unfortunately, a different trend is clear, even\\nto suicide and to the central word in the noun. This dominates our\\nthoughts 24 / 7 omnipresent. Behind the most adjectives, the core of\\neach sentence lies the inconspicuous word. It has spread in the minds as\\nwell as in language. The obscurity increases when it leaves out, at the\\nsame time it underlines the extraordinary importance. Even if one takes a\\nfalse position and there is a lost cause Is more important than ever that It\\nis not like one. The academics formulate, both good and drum rum, let it\\nprivate, she died Sandstone tiling it constantly. Like all doomed. This is\\nsad but also true, and hardly worth mentioning because it has on the\\ncourse of this history and any other control. If you like the base Is\\nnegligible. The brief mention here only for completeness. In scientific\\ncircles there is a clear world, more precisely, it is useful to us worlds that\\nare so much different than yours. We are very close, as her somewhat at\\nthe outer edge, yet never has a probe the earth to achieve anything\\nclose. What for? It provides such missions very far to the rear.

Nef is about\\nto break the ice and push out a greeting, as to him the curious Svinenysh\\ngehoppelt comes in between: \"Hem ha hum, how you look!\" Says the\\nrepellent, his body takes on a slightly hinted flight entertainment. Then he\\nasks sheepishly, \"you\\'re dangerous?\" Nef takes young Ruba targeted,\\nclearly surprised, \"Holy crap.

He turns instead prefer Patchara Petch-a boon to\\nHenley and Prince of Westerburg, \"Well, what do we have here for two\\nhops? Nobody comes up here voluntarily, with the least over there. \"He\\npoints to his wild nephew. \"Have you been up to what?\" Instead of\\nreplying to view and Patchara Henley uncomfortable. Still, you have\\ntaken too little faith in this dark prison guards. Fortunately, you come to\\nthe aid Mikkel: \"This is Patchara Petch-a-boon,\" he began without\\npreamble, \"and Henley to Westerburg over from the Indi-system.\"\\nThereupon the latter Nef looks closely at times, \"Westerburg? Well, there\\nwas something that Kill, yes, | remember. Your father was recently here\\nwith us? \"Henley nods. \"Has made me a very patents impression of\\nWesterburg,\" said Nef continues, \"although our government for whatever\\nreasons, different looks.\" \"He wanted to know how we handle it around\\nhere.

He has visited the arid Andes\\ntrotting along with his parents. The dominant species of the world He is\\nalso still in your memory. Who could forget? Impressive are the Etto\\naviation with up to five meters in wingspan. You could easily carry a man,\\nbut unfortunately they are still untamed. It is impossible to train these\\nproud birds. In captivity they are quickly absorbed and before you can\\nenslave you rather die. There is therefore no one had succeeded you to\\ntrain dressage some stupid number, much less than you demote animal\\ntransport. So you continue to live independently in the vast steppe. They\\nserve both the long-distance travelers, a trip to another planet is still seen\\nas such, as an attraction; At the same time you decimate your big\\nappetite by the abundant marsupials on the Exo. One could also say they\\nare the custodians of the countryside of the Andes trot. Nef continues:\\n\"As mentioned | have no idea why the hold our so little about your father.\\nThe military will always strange to us. \" \"If | only think it was a crazy bird,\\nthey have delivered here three days ago ... I\\'ve seen it all, but something\\n'</li>\n",
       "\t<li>'like this or is even new to me.\" Mikkel interjects: \"Why?

We have confirmed all but robo-\\ntechnology, which interests us all, do not you, Mikkel \"she\\'s lying. This\\nnods immediately. Nef looks around the room, including the astonished\\nSvinenysh. Then he finally says: \"Yes, I\\'ll give you a little guidance so\\ntimes. But later! A bit of what I\\'m still in daily business to do.

Patchara finds the other hand this is\\nstill far too little learning material. Fortunately, there\\'s a knock on the door\\nshortly thereafter.

Eevi lives pretty inside edge, near the Rocktars what\\textbackslash{}nHenley immediately noticed. He immediately takes a plan, but first it shall\\textbackslash{}ncommunicate this to his friends and above all to convince these young\\textbackslash{}nPakingerin. \"What are you exactly on September Celebrate Christmas?\"\\textbackslash{}nPatchara asks curiously, the new running mate. Eevi starts talking: \"Well,\\textbackslash{}nif \\textbar{} only knew. Some say the berry season, the other end of the summer.\\textbackslash{}nKnow it does not.

The\\textbackslash{}ntime for diplomacy is over already, so quickly it happens in children, the\\textbackslash{}nyoung prince comes to the point: \"Eevi, we would have to borrow one of\\textbackslash{}nyour short time Rocktars. \\textbar{} promise to watch it too. \" The reaction of Eevi\\textbackslash{}nLund Barden is it any different than expected.

That is why it is so quiet. The young prince continues: \"Just as |\\nwas Slapped Eivind, my father would have done the same. The treat me\\nlike a wailing baby.

They just\\ndie away in denial and lethargy. Ultimately, like the nature of a Paking\\nyours. This ts still the main reason why you are left alone. Of course the\\nplanet is developed for tourists.

We need help to do all. \\\" Henley clears his throat. \\\"I think\\nit's time for a real show. You know me already, because the one who Is\\nover there Patchara Petch a boon from the province of Xonburi Trivy the\\nRaah-system ... \\\" Eevi curious looks at the young Asian diplomat's\\ndaughter, Patchara looks back, as always reluctant. It is your innate\\nnature. Yes, the differences are huge. On the one hand, the pale blond\\nNordmann daughter with bright blue eyes, on the other Patchara Petch-a\\nboon with your black almond eyes and long shiny jet-black mane.\\nPerhaps because both are equally appealing. They wave to him and say\\n\\\"hi\\\". Now it gets complicated for Henley, someone special is waiting now\\nto be presented to it. \\\"My colleagues here is second Svinenysh Gal ...\\nforgiveness is the Svinenysh Ruba from the green Jungelmond Trymoo\\nTrivy. He speaks a bit twisted but otherwise he is the force! \\\" \\\"Hello Hello\\\"\\nis the called back immediately, \\\"You are who?\\\" As a fast learner, he\\nstretched out his hand to your right. Eevi then goes on to him and shakes\\nyou. \\\"I'm Eevi Lund Bard, proud Pakingerin here from the province of\\nSarpsborg. Is it a problem with your nose? \\\" Sving there are rough and\\ntough: \\\"Noo powerful. Sure, everything is very good.

At the\\nSeptember celebration. \\\" The band takes off, soon the tent is the place\\nPaking achieved. Eevi lives pretty inside edge, near the Rocktars what\\nHenley immediately noticed. He immediately takes a plan, but first it shall\\ncommunicate this to his friends and above all to convince these young\\nPakingerin. \\\"What are you exactly on September Celebrate Christmas?\\\"\\nPatchara asks curiously, the new running mate. Eevi starts talking: \\\"Well,\\nif | only knew. Some say the berry season, the other end of the summer.\\nKnow it does not. But instead we have a great stage show with the top\\nacts of the Pakingschen Mukke. \\\" Patchara Henley and look at each\\nother.

The\\ntime for diplomacy is over already, so quickly it happens in children, the\\nyoung prince comes to the point: \\\"Eevi, we would have to borrow one of\\nyour short time Rocktars. | promise to watch it too. \\\" The reaction of Eevi\\nLund Barden is it any different than expected.
